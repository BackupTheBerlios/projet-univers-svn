  /// Technical framework
  /*!
    This module contains the technical implementation for Model/View/control 
    used throughout the project. 
    
  @par The model part

    It defines Kernel::Model that represent a set of Kernel::Object organised 
    in a hierarchical manner. Each Kernel::Object has Kernel::Trait that 
    contains the various semantic informations. 
    
    The system has some deduction capabilmities some Kernel::Trait may be 
    deduced from other, and their adding removal is completelly automatic.
    
    For now (0.2.2) only logic formulas (And, Or, Not) over the traits of the 
    same object are allowed. Furthermore, each contruct may only have 10 
    children.   
    
    Examples :
    - <code>DeclareDeducedTrait(Whole,Not(HasTrait(Component))) ;</code>
      It states that every object that does not have the Component trait 
      have the whole trait. If one add the component trait on an object 
      the Whole trait is removed
    - <code>DeclareDeducedTrait(PhysicalObject,
                                And(HasTrait(Mobile),
                                    HasTrait(Positionned),
                                    HasTrait(Massive),
                                    HasTrait(Whole))) ;</code>
      PhysicalObject are exactly those objects that are both Mobile, 
      Positionned, Massive and Whole.
      
    
    Formulaes cannot be recursive (i.e. one cannot define a trait from itself).
    
  @par The view part
    
    A Kernel::ViewPoint represents a set of coherent Kernel::TraitView on a 
    Kernel::Model object. 
    
    Kernel::TraitView are automatically attached to Kernel::Trait by using  
    DeclareView declaration :
    
    Declaration : <code>RegisterView(ViewClass,TraitClass,ViewPointClass) ;
    </code> will generate the following behaviour :
    - for each initialised object of class @c ViewPointClass a new instance of  
      @c ViewClass will be attached on every instance of @c TraitClass
    - these instances will be notified of @c TraitClass object changes, 
      removal, ... 
    
  @par The Controler part
    
    Same as view part except :
    - Kernel::ControlerSet have a @c simulate method that perform a bottom-up 
      or top-down call to @c simulate method for Kernel::Controler of the 
      ControlerSet.
