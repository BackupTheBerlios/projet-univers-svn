      Exemple: the sound buffer becomes empty and the sound stop, because i 
      can't write on the hard disk the log's flow when an application use 
      another sector of the hard disk.

      case in C++. The solution resides in a singleton constructed as a static 
      local variable of the singleton::get method, @see cppunit implementation.

      efx is activated on windows. Two tests are not launched because they 
      would require two much refactoring.
	  - used Ogre resource manager to retreive sound files : they should be now 
	    put in Media subfolders and registered through ressources.cfg
    - moved deduced trait to sound::implementation level, renamed views

	* Model :
	  - renamed Hearing into Listener

2008-05-24 rogma

  * Sound :
    - added sound event basic test
  * Kernel : 
    - added deduced trait on parentship : HasParent(T) is true iff object has 
      trait T or if a parent has trait T. It is updated whenever getParent<T> 
      returns a different object or getParent<T> is the same but this T has 
      been updated.  
    	For example HasParent(Positionned) should be used instead of 
    	HasTrait(Positionned) allowing to skip Positionned trait for sub 
    	objects...
  * Display :
    - added space dust effect on Observer to show speed to user

2008-07-03 rogma

  * All :
    - added 'make doxygen-doc' for doxygen documentation generation 
  * Kernel :
    - added RegisterViewPoint and RegisterControlerSet : the idea is to declare 
      "global" viewpoints and controler sets such as Display, Sound, Physic, ...
      that are automaticaly built on any "global" model provided it has been 
      declared and viewpoint is built with a model parameter
    - added Object interface for adding sub-objects, traits ... no need to go 
      through Model anymore
    - viewpoints and controlers are destroyed when associated model is
    - removing of old dated interface
    - viewpoints are initialised first and destroyed last (a quite bad hack for 
      intialising Display before Input)
    - Bug correction : valgrind reported memory errors on tests (deduce traits)
      initial evaluation of formulae accessed to Trait validity whereas Trait 
      validity is not stored into the validity vector of object

    - initial creation
    - GameState represents splash screen, menu, and game 
    - added basic controler for quitting game state, transition to other state
  * Model :

    - added CustomMission to represent configurable melee (still beta)
    - added GameState to be able to quit
    - added Image to make spash screens
  * Display :

      searching Player + Observer trait
    - adapted tests to new system, removed all calls to init(), update(), 
      close() of modules
    - modified Ogre intialisation : Ogre is initialised on the first display 
      viewpoint initialisation, and closed either at demand or at the end of 
      the program.  
    - added Image display
  * Physic :
    - modified construction of controler set, no observer needed.
    - corrected a bug on PhysicalObject : initial value of m_being_updated was 
      random
    - adapted tests to new system, removed all calls to init(), update(), 
      close() of modules
    - added initOde, closOde in PhysicSystem init/close
    - added deduced view on Solid and PhysicalObjetc to correct a bug : 
      when adding Solid trait before PhysicalObject was deduced, solid where 
      attached to "nothing"
  * ArtificialIntelligence :
    - modified construction of controler set, no observer needed.
    - adapted tests to new system, removed all calls to init(), update(), 
      close() of modules
  * Input :
    - changed input to a controler set
    - made a controler on Player using PlayerConfiguration to get 'key'/command 
      mapping
    - added GameState controler : always quit on escape key
    - added basic tests
    - added Menu input injection (keyboard and mouse)
  * Demonstration :
    - modified to use Game module

2008-07-03 rogma
  
  * All : 
    - removed non iso characters and some french in the comments
    - changed some typo in comments
    - removed some obsolete files

2008-07-03 rogma

  * Model :
    - removed position from Collision, now use a Positionned trait instead
  * Input :
    - corrected bugs in menu inputs

2008-07-05 rogma
  
  * All :
    - corrected bug on windows : a DLL without an entry point has no way to 
      initialize static variables except for very simple types such as 
      integers. Caused some deduced traits not to be registered. Solution 
      reside in having only one dynamic library for each module. 

  * Sound :
    - made OpenAl initialised only once.

2008-07-05 rogma
  
  * All :
    - corrected bug on windows : libraries need entry point in order to have 
      static initialisation called 

2008-07-08 rogma
  
  * All :
    - added terminate entry point to all viewpoints/controler sets 
    - added entry point calls in all tests
    - added automatic generation of Ogre plugins.cfg by discovering plugin path
  * sound
    - changed tests : all in one executable
    - terminate destroy all OpenAL system
  * Input :
    - corrected failure whith no joystick

2008-07-08 rogma (version 0.3.1)
  
  * All : 
    - tagging version 0.3.1

2008-07-10 rogma

  * Display : 
    - added rendering display choice for demo
  * Input :
    - added mouse sensibility configured in ini file

2008-07-12 rogma

  * Input :
    - corrected a bug : at very low speed, mouse did not move
  * Display :  
    - added basic menu command interpretor : get gui event and print them to 
      std::cout
    - CEGUI menu is linked to it's corresponding Model::Menu

2008-07-28 rogma

  * Display :  
    - removed all CEGUI related stuff : moved to GUI module
  * GUI :
    - creation
    - added it's own SceneManager and camera
    - added PlayerConfiguration GUI : record command/key mapping 
    - usage of Displayed trait for activating special controler on elements
  * Kernel :
    - added access to all registered commands and axes
  * Input : 
    - added PlayerConfiguration input handling
    - factorisation of menu input handling in InputMenu
    - moved all ois specific to ois sub-module
    - usage of Displayed trait for activating special controler on elements
  * Model : 
    - added traits Played and Dislayed for menu/missions
    - added trait GameConfiguration for general options
    - removed GameState and added WithTransitions that handle transitions 
      between objects
    - added EndOfSimulation that will destroy all objects of the model and 
      ending the main loop 
  * Game :
    - suppresion of the module
    
2008-07-29 rogma
  
  * Display :
    - added a background viewport that is cleared, allowing several viewports 
      one over the other
    - it solve the issue with images that would be displayed only if there 
      exists an observer 

2008-08-07 rogma
    
    - bug correction : when ode was not installed, configure succeeded whereas 
      it should not
  * GUI :
    - corrected a segmentation fault on CommandInterpretor
    - added a system to show mouse cursor when needed
  * Model :
    - made a basic sequence of menus
    - added a Mission trait that perform sub-loading of the scene 
  * Kernel :
    - corrected a bug on applyTopDown/applyBottomUp on controlers : during 
      simulation the set of traits of the currently browsed object may vary
  * Display :
    - bug on explosions : having multiple scene managers and changing a texture 
      causes a bug : create only one scene manager on demand, and create a 
      viewport on demand on it (during creation for observer, remove the vieport 
      and recerate a new one...) 
      @see http://www.ogre3d.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=189032#189032

2008-08-08 rogma
    
  * Model :
    - Logic::LogicSystem : corrected a bug, when destroying objects, new objects
      to be destroy where added causing a bug
    - WithTransitions is more versatile : it only adds Displayed iff not already
      present  

2008-08-12 rogma
  
  * modifications for windows compiling : 
    - gui/makefile : added input lib
    - input/makefile : added sub dir option

2008-08-13 rogma
  
  * Sound : 
    - added test.wav for openal_lib_test
  * All : 
    - added xml tests output 
    
@todo :
  
  * All : 
    - add Game controler and trait for handling team respawn ...
      a Transponder^Ship controler that count the number of alive ships, same 
      for teams and handle respawn
      Custom mission controler dealt with victory/ending conditions and leads 
      to game over state
      Avoid blocking game when player is dead. 
    - considered in a lot of places that Z axis is forward... whereas Ogre 
      consider negative Z as forward ??? 
    - make install does not work on win32 : libtool refuses to link with Ogre 
      (wheread it works in normal make !!)
    - some changes due to gcc 4.3 (not urgent)
    - a lot of kernel tests fails on gcc 4.3 (not urgent)
    - migrate sound module to use openal-soft ? (not urgent) 
     
  * Model : 
    - Event traits like Collision, Shot should be implemented through 
      a common interface : Model::Event base class...
      Maybe better to have a Kernel::Event because Controler or View cannot 
      have an update method (it has no meaning)   
         
    - ShootingHelper may connect several lasers (calculus is made on 
      average speed) and can harmonize lasers (re-orient them to touch a 
      position in the ship axe and at target distance)

    - Laser whould not be able to be too much synchronized (max angle)

    - Lasers on a ship should all point to the same direction, which is the 
      direction of the ship ... coherence test

    - add configurable laser colour (depending of laser beam type)
    
    - Detector : handle of additional data (hit points, ...)
      They can both be obtained by the detector. Maybe we should use traits 
      instead of class attributes for increasing extendability (by adding speed 
      ...). Detectors could then be caractrized by their detection abilities :
      SpeedDetector&MassDetector... but it is not clear now

    - be able to get bouding box (?) and perform ray 
      casting inside Model. Code could rely on Ogre but we would be an 
      encapsulation.
    
    - should define isInside like 
      IsInside <=> parent(Positionned ^ Sized) ^ Positionned
      i.e., being decendent means that we are inside 
      changing node position can then move object hierarchy
    
    - PhysicalWorld <=> Whole ??
      PhysicalObject should not depend on mobile ?
    
    - add another type of transition : open a new "state" while not closing the
      old one
    - add a transition that allows to close any oppened state while oppening 
      another ? 

  * GUI : 
    - add key shortcuts for clicable buttons  
   
  * Display :
    - seg fault when having an Oriented object that is not Positionned, use 
      a deduction like : Oriented and HasParent(Positionned) 
    - all Solid parent of an Observer invisible : but only in the case it is 
      the current observer
    - when initing ogre, close any already openned ogre objects in other 
      modules
    - find a way to preload ressources as needed (some ressources may appear 
      during game like explosions, lasers) some ressources are known like 
      ships...
    - make a loading bar : create a ressource loading queue (inspire from 
      Ogre::ResourceBackgroundQueue that is not by default on ogre package)  
    
    
  * Input :
    - be able to map any axis on anything
    - send wheel mouse to CEGUI
    - add a key sensibility, here the key is sent several times per seconds
    - add a key repetition in CEGUI for text insertion
    - add Maj+Control in key handling : treat them as modifiers ?
    - handle axes in gui input mapping, allow mouse for piloting
  
  * Physic : 
    - try to keep all units in an acceptable "range", it means that we whould 
      be able to convert model units in an arbitrary "ranging system".
    - migrate Model::PhysicalObject and Model::PhysicalWorld to Physic (for 
      better separation of concerns) --> not so sure ?
    - separate simulations : maybe objects can be simulated one by one in its 
      own world !! should not have any complication for movement except for 
      collision response. This could facilitate unit range to keep around one.
    - add deduced trait for solid controler : allow adding of solid trait 
      before physical object
    - be more precise than bounding sphere for collision : use bounding box for 
      example 
    
  * Sound : 
    - reconsider the implementation with the limitation 
    - check that Positionned is correctly used, I suspect that position update 
      is not done when a ship moves while containing the listener
    - engine sound does not weem to work ?
    - change Engine gain accoarding to engine "power" and current applied 
      throttle
    - add Shot sound
    - every event sound is the same : make a general view on event and get the 
      sound name by a function 
    - segmentation fault when sound is already used by another process
    - infinite loop when no sound device is found...
    
  * Kernel :
    
    - refactoring : viewpoint and controler set have a lot in common...
    - add better errors on object structure
    - maybe call axis should take a Percentage
    - be able to copy an object, use read and add a write to Traits.
    - controlers may change structure during simulate call : this is done 
      during a browse all objects and could cause seg fault... maybe we should 
      synchronize structural object modifications to happen at the end of a 
      applyTopDown/applyBottomUp by recording all strutural calls and playing 
      them at the end ?? 
      @see Model::Implementation::Logic::LogicSystem::m_objects_to_destroy that 
      already perform that kind of recording stuff...
    
  * all :
    - make use of Quantities library, 
      @see http://sourceforge.net/projects/quantity ??
    - correct the coordinate system; Stick/Throttle must use correct 
      orientation
