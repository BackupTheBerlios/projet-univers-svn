2007-10-13 Minos
  
  * sound  :
    - add manager and reader for streaming
    - deduction of trait information for position, orientation and speed
    - for the compilation now, Ogg, Vorbis, Vorbisfile and libsndfile are needed
    
  * todos :
    -  sound : 
      - just keep relative model to a global reference
      - tests configuration in movement
    
2007-10-21 Minos

  * model :
    - add ear to represent the hearing of player
    - add listener, deduced trait for the sound (ear, positionned, ...)
    - add engine_sound, deduced trait for the sound (ear, positionned, ...)
  * sound :
    - add listener to replace observer, observe Model::listener

    - sound_emitter now implements default behavior
    - some fix on sound_emitter and sound_listener in properties setting.
    - openal now is configure in software mode, hardware (nvidia integrated shipset in my case)
      don't work for moving alone listener, and later for some effect
  * test :
    - add moving_object, source move on three axis
    - add cone_propertie, a listener turn around an engine and heard the variation with the angle
  * todos :
    - sound :
      - global effect on the mixed sound in function of Model::ear state

2007-10-29 Minos

  * model :
    - move sound deduced trait to sound module
  * sound :
    - rename viewer and refactor to not have conflit with deduced trait now in sound module
  * note : 
    - Log can cause bug, the kernel begin to be too verbose ~20mo/sec in the 
      test_cone_propertie.
      Exemple: the sound buffer becomes empty and the sound stop, because i 
      can't write on the hard disk the log's flow when an application use 
      another sector of the hard disk.
  
2007-10-30 Minos

  * kernel :
    - Parameters.cxx: add exception when the parameter name in getValue() doesn't exist
  * sound :
    - SoundListener: refactor, implements a default behavior like SoundEmitter
    - OpenAL: 
      > add initialisation in software or hardware mode according to the configuration file
      > add parameter for attenuation model choice
      > add EFX extension launch, version test
      > add EFX functions pointer initialisation
    - Manager: 
      >add updateTime according to the configuration file to manage the time between update and buffers' size
      >fix bug in streaming, know we assure no famine with an update rate a little more important than buffer size
    - WavReader:
      >fix bug to follow the same algorithm than OggReader and ensure a buffer of the good size for looping sound
    - Test:
      >TestOpenALInit: add new basic test to know the platform possibilities
      >TestEffect: add basic test to see how effect work
      
2007-11-3 Minos

  * model :
    - SoundEnvironnement : add , just for save, it will change taking into consideration the hardware limitation
  * sound :
    - SoundEnvironnementView : add , just for save, it will change taking into consideration the hardware limitation
    - Filter : add
    - Sound::close : fix bug when closing Sound before Model, the sound viewpoint wasn't destroy before openal 
    - SoundEmitter, Reader : fix bug when changeParent() on a source, the close() init() serie destroyed the reader but didn't reinitialize
                     fix the position where restart, artefact remain
    - Test:
      >TestFilter: add test of add-sub action on filter
      >TestEffect: refactor with CPPUNIT ASSERT in place of log, add some test to know the hardware limitation
      
2007-11-11 rogma

2008-02-26 rogma
  * All :
    - doxygen comment cleanup (removed warnings) 
  * Model :
    - DetectionData are added Mobile trait iff exists
    - ShootingHelper : build a false target to shoot at using speed of current 
      selected target (basic test added)
  * Kernel :
    - corrected some bugs/limitations : 
      - crash when building a ViewPoint with NULL model (tested)
      - no view init on new objects when changing the model of a initialised 
        viewpoint plus some crash on it (tested)
        
todos :

  * targets :
      They can both be obtained by the detector. Maybe we should use traits 
      instead of class attributes for increasing extendability (by adding speed 
      ...). Detectors could then be caractrized by their detection abilities :
      SpeedDetector&MassDetector... but it is not clear now
  
  * model :
    - be able to get bouding box (?) and perform ray 
      casting inside Model. Code could rely on Ogre but we would be an 
      encapsulation.
       
  * physic : 
    - try to keep all units in an acceptable "range", it means that we whould 
      be able to convert model units in an arbitrary "ranging system".
    - migrate Model::PhysicalObject and Model::PhysicalWorld to Physic (for 
      better separation of concerns) --> not so sure ?
    - separate simulations : maybe objects can be simulated one by one in its 
      own world !! should not have any complication for movement except for 
      collision response. This could facilitate unit range to keep around one. 

  * sound : 
    - reconsider the implementation with the limitation 
    - perform platform dependent compilation for special sound effects
    - move deduced trait to sound::implementation level (i.e. one up) ??

  * all :
    - make use of Quantities library, @see http://sourceforge.net/projects/quantity ??

  * kernel : (obsolete kept for documentation purpose)
    - add an onDeduced event on deduced traits : it would allow one to perform 
      custom code, for example to calculate deduced attribute in those traits. 
      e.g., Solid <=> Sized, and Sized.size = Solid.Mesh.radius
      Not mandatory because it can be calculate "on demand" in a getSize method 
      in the deduced trait with a mutable attribute.
