      Example: the sound buffer becomes empty and the sound stop, because i 
      can't write on the hard disk the log's flow when an application use 
      another sector of the hard disk.

      returns a different object or getParent<T> is the same but this T has 
      been updated.  
    	For example HasParent(Positionned) should be used instead of 
    	HasTrait(Positionned) allowing to skip Positionned trait for sub 
    	objects...
  * Display :
    - added space dust effect on Observer to show speed to user

2008-07-03 rogma

  * All :
    - added 'make doxygen-doc' for doxygen documentation generation

      that are automaticaly built on any "global" model provided it has been 
      declared and viewpoint is built with a model parameter
    - added Object interface for adding sub-objects, traits ... no need to go 
      through Model anymore
    - viewpoints and controlers are destroyed when associated model is
    - removing of old dated interface
    - viewpoints are initialised first and destroyed last (a quite bad hack for 
      intialising Display before Input)
    - Bug correction : valgrind reported memory errors on tests (deduce traits)
      initial evaluation of formulae accessed to Trait validity whereas Trait 
      validity is not stored into the validity vector of object

      viewpoint initialisation, and closed either at demand or at the end of 
      the program.  
    - added Image display
  * Physic :
    - modified construction of controler set, no observer needed.
    - corrected a bug on PhysicalObject : initial value of m_being_updated was

      close() of modules
    - added initOde, closOde in PhysicSystem init/close

      when adding Solid trait before PhysicalObject was deduced, solid where 
      attached to "nothing"

    - modified construction of controler set, no observer needed.
    - adapted tests to new system, removed all calls to init(), update(), 
      close() of modules

      integers. Caused some deduced traits not to be registered. Solution 
      reside in having only one dynamic library for each module. 

  * Sound :
    - made OpenAl initialised only once.

2008-07-05 rogma
  
  * All :
    - corrected bug on windows : libraries need entry point in order to have 
      static initialisation called

    - add energy collision on the collision (preliminary version)

2009-09-22

  * Sound : 
    - added variable gain on collision depending on collision energy
    - added distance culling on sources 
    - make speed on listener optional
  * Physics : 
    - added internal checks to simplify debug
    - added a "hacky" max on torque generator to avoid generating too high forces

2009-10-05

  * Sound :
    - better distance culling : we do not create nor source nor reader 
 
  * Kernel :
    - basic profiling on user methods (onInit,onUpdate,onClose,simulate,prepare)
      plus system methods
    - corrected benchmarking test (demonstration/test) that was not correct, 
      ships are placed on a circle and the size of that circle must depend on 
      number of ships.
    - added an option to demonstration/test to output profiling results

2009-10-10

  * Kernel :
    - cleaning
    - adding statistics on update propagation
    - update only once a trait per round 

2009-10-10

  * Physics :
    - remove hack in Model and place it in Physics (both torque and force)
    - adding a capping in physics reduces instability on ship stabilizer

2009-10-12

  * Model : 
    - selected target going out of range will not be unselected
    - issue with selection repaired but I do not know how to make a unit test
    - repaired shooting helper
  
  * Kernel :
    - repair getLatestUpdatedTrait()

  * Sound :
    - corrected sound status changes, corrects engine sound not played during 
      demo

2009-10-24

  * Kernel : 
    - added test suite name to all tests

2009-10-30

  * use explosion effect instead of mesh

2009-10-31

  * All :
    - tests : configured output for eclipse error integration, see 
      http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/cdt-core-dev/msg00563.html
    - removed all config parameters, use default value instead. Config parameters 
      where different from module to module and conduct to weird behaviors.
  
  * AI :
    - corrects issues with ship fleeing : when two ships aim at each other... 
      they flee perpendicularly
    - agents now avoid obstacle  

2009-11-01

  * Model :
    - removed obsolete detection data  
  * Kernel : 
    - removed error messages for getting paramterers with default value

2009-11-12

  * Display : 
    - added an effect managment system for particle with lifetime
  * Physic :
    - added a call to dRandSetSeed which is meant to reduce instability ?
    - better log in case of error
    - unstability under windows on forces and torque : reverted modification 
      in stabilizer

2009-11-13

  * Physic :
    - unstability under windows on forces and torque : moved to dWorldQuickStep

2009-11-21

  * Kernel : 
    - corrected crash on savePlayerConfiguration

2009-11-22

  * Display : 
    - effect managment system : handle resizing
    - all resizable elements have their own node (solid, effects)

2010-02-22
  * Kernel : 
    - corrected bug in intercetor algorithm
  * Model :
    - corrected HasInLineOfSight is wrong
  * Display :
    - coherence error on LaserBeam view
  * Damage handling
    - Hit visualization localized on ship : emit particles at collision point
    - repair collision point given by physics
       - added dGeomTriMeshSetLastTransform magic but does not do the trick
       - smaller timestep (0.05) and higher CFM (>= 10) works for these 
         collisions and a number of collision point to 10
   * AI :
     - corrected pursuit at distance offset, but removed avoid collision

2010-02-26 
  * demonstration : 
    - corrected test closing
    - corrected test xml outputing
  * All :
    - mass correction, but still some work

2010-02-27 
  * Physic :
    - 'corrected' collision test fail on windows. Too high laser speed go 
      through 


2010-03-07 
  * Kernel :
    - optimisation : removed all time consuming unnecessary elements introduced 
      (profiling, logs, debug infos...)
    - added event listener system to dynamically connect debugging, profiling...

2010-04-12 
  * a lot of time passed inside getparameters exceptions : removed exceptions 
    for access with default value

  * Object::_get() is slow when trait is not present : 
    - split traits in two parts (deduced and not deduced) 

2010-05-03
  * Display :
    - particule emission is the cost killer, reverted explosion/hit to billboard
  * Model : 
    - Bug exploding solid are still shootable (ai fire on destroying objects)

2010-05-18 
  * Display :
    - corrected display bug due to scaling
    
  * ship application
    - added ship name parameter
    - added basic camera movement      

  * Model : 
    - Bug exploding solid are still shootable (ai fire on destroying objects)
    - remove them from detection
    - change collision for exploding solid
    - desactivate AI for exploding parent
    - destruction add explosion to element

  * Display :
    - exploding solid display explosion animation if exists, otherwise hide the 
      mesh

2010-05-27 
  * All
    - updated all lib versions
    - rLog caused weird compilation issue resolved by http://code.google.com/p/rlog/issues/detail?id=13
    - porting to Ogre 1.6 require some small change in code (one deprecated method)
      and explicit declaration of particle_system
    - still physic issue with solid/laser collisions, try to fix it by removing some 
      small contact points 

2010-05-29 
  * Display corrected test
  * upgraded meshes    

2010-07-03
  * All : removed errors found by valgrind         

2010-07-04
  * Kernel : closing order bug correction in case of model destruction or 
    viewpoint/controlerset closing
 
  * Model :
    - change laser beam size

2010-09-19

  * Physic/Display/Model :
    - change laser beam size
    - change all .ship files with beam size

  * Physics:
    - extrude laser beam length up to max(delta_time*speed,length) = deplacement performed 
      during one step @see 
      http://www.bulletphysics.org/mediawiki-1.5.8/index.php?title=Collision_Detection_and_Physics_FAQ#How_can_I_avoid_missing_collisions_for_fast_moving_objects
      and use ray
      
  * Physics/Model:
    - bug : laser 'go through'; moved destruction of laser to the init of 
      collision  

2010-09-19
  * Display engine output

2010-09-19
  * corrections for ship definitions

2010-09-26
  * Kernel : removed production of debugging graphs in kernel tests
  * indicate on hud when taken as a target

2010-10-03
* indicates on hud the ship damages, speed, ship name
  - added HasComponent relation calculated from Whole/Component

2010-10-04
* bug : broken space dust effect
* bug : ship name color is not affected by other colors
* created overlay to place ship name, speed, hull life points

2010-10-04
* indicates target speed on HUD

2010-10-16
* bip when enemy is in line of sight
- ok, but a little too precise, need 
* corrected compile error on gcc 4.5
* corrected some issues for compiling on windows/mingw 4.3

2010-10-16

- stick, reticule, ideal target, target(plus name/target), arrow
    
2010-10-18
* customisation of field of view, not finished yet
* changed default sky
* laser beam speed should be configurable from xml 

2010-10-20
* desactivating stick because ugly
* seg fault when destroying engine sound
- corrected an issue on unqueuing buffer in Reader, hope it corrects

- added basic tutorial with enet

2010-10-24
#5146 Create base network system
- Connection between two players
  - Client, Server trait
  - three states : Connected, Connecting and Disconnected
  - basic connection tests
    
in commit
--------


in progress
-----------

   
@todo
----

* sound still error logged, they seem no critical but should investigate
  
#5146 Create base network system
- change state should disconnect from server
- gui to host, gui to connect
- System of Chat on the interface
- Launch and configuration of a game
  - need synchro and sub states for launching : Loading, Ready, Started
   
  
#5137 Add the Hull level of the Target
#5139 Add a Shield system
- Damages
- move all hud elements to hud viewpoint (necessary ? : we will have several 
  views on the same elements); not necessary due to deduced traits.
#5138 Add a "target View" element

* bip when enemy is in line of sight
- probably need a less precise HasInLineOfSight
  
* laser beam is ugly seen from player

* Display engine output : still some issues : induced black on transparency...

* make player feel when destroyed

* network 
- connection room
- game

* handle several engine for an engine controller. 

* bug : exploding objects cannot perform any action... see todos on explosion
- exploding objects must be detroyed and another one created at the same 
  position + same speed

* have all used ships in the same size range then use new 3d models s51 and 
  others

* all :
- performances : try to generate a big exe without dll...

* handle several laser on the same ship 
- Kernel command delegator : handle multiple sub element of the same type 
  (several laser)
  
* Display :
- exploding solid should fade to transparent ?

* ship file format is shit, too complex
* input configuration menu is shit also, too technical

* Model : 
- Mission : destruction sequence during player's ship explosion 
  (Player & Parent(Explosion)) --> change current camera to a fixed one 
- move player from ship to explosion ?

* Display : issue with fonts in Ogre 1.6.1 windows version; they are too big.

* GUI :
- select ship from a list
- add a list selection in gui config (or use a new windows)
- change all hover/pushed elements inspire from  
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/galactitrade/
  (apache v2 can be used inside GPLv3)
  
* Bug : during game, when destroyed for the last time ? --> dark screen
- not repoduced

* Bug : clicking between buttons on the in game menu causes blockade 

* Demo :
- history of who killed who (need to add the transponder on the LaserBeam 
  object) warning, firing ship on laser beam can have been destroyed...
- score menu at the end of the mission

* Display :
- display score on hud
  
* All :
- physic mass correction, but still some work

* performance issues
- a lot of time passed in Computer::getDetectedObjects() mostly in 
  getChildrenObjects<Detectable> ?
- some time inside call(method), inside getChildren<X> 
- TypeIdentifier::isInstance is very slow but any attempt to optimised 
  failed

* Kernel :
- debugger

* performance measures : 
  valgrind --tool=callgrind --fn-skip=ProjetUnivers::Kernel::Trait::notify --fn-skip=ProjetUnivers::Kernel::Implementation::Interpretor::endTransaction
  still cycles... due to end transaction... 

* Physic 
- performances tests 

* Display :
- ressource caching is not 'clean'; handling of scene manager is not clean 
  too @see the hack of cleaning the manager must clean the caching ressource 
  list 
 
* Model : 
- try to calculate HasInLineOfSight through ogre ray intersection ?
- or through same in physics ?

* Model (refactoring) : 
- remove computer own model and create an ideal target object under the 
  computer with relative position  

* All :
- remove warning for implicit conversions with gcc-4.3
  
* AI : 
- adding states : Iddle, Attacking,
- use hierarchical behavioural tree 
- users repport that AI tend to get back on back (probably a worst case 
  scenario in the algorithm)

* Model :
- add relationship HasEnemy between teams
- add relationship HasFlyingGroup to replace WithFlyingGroup
- add trait Destroyed on FlyingGroup + controler that handle that trait
- mission should be finished when all enemies are destroyed  
- we should add victory conditions to missions : DestroyAllEnemies, 
  determine match with agent objectives 

* Display : 
- change selection printing (change color of ideal target)

* Ship configuration
- Energy handling 

* Shields
- Commands on energy (transfer shield to front, back...) 

* Kernel : 
- maybe something to do on notify : directly calls the update on connected 
  traits that have views
- detect which observers have "default" update, may be usefull for better 
  optimisations 

* Physics :
- try to keep all units in an acceptable "range", it means that we whould 
  be able to convert model units in an arbitrary "ranging system", depending 
  on masses and object length  

* Display :
- singleton issue when data is not correct (duplicate elements inside media 
  folder) 
 
* Sound : 
- exception floating point : not reproduced
- too many sources 114 simultaneous sources with 30 ships 
- event limitation : a pool of sources of given size, with circular assignment

* All : 
- remove magic constant for config files parameter names ?
   
* Continuous integration :
- deployment should also publish tests results
- migrate to ant
- use cccc
-use cppdepend (free for open source)
- profile with valgrind (cachegrind) valgrind --tool=callgrind + kcachegrind 
  for visualisation
- use valgrind for leaks (a lot on kernel tests, try whithout -O2) + invalid access
  invalid access should crash make check (xml output and a check for Invalid Acess)
- add benchmark testing

* Input :
- instability on test autorepeat

* on test : Display::TetModelView::ChangeParent, destruction of model leads 
  to gpf in Ode::Solid::onClose
  --> a major bug on the untested and too early feature changeParent, see 
  kernel todos   
  
* Kernel : 
- detect illegal access in view/controler, an illegal access is accessing a 
  trait/view/controler that is not part of the formula

- we should use onChangedParent() for formulae on parent instead of 
  onUpdate, onChangeParent is exactly the event that indicates that the 
  formula is still true but through another one
  
  bug for change parent in display and physics shows that this feature is 
  still out of scope because too difficult, we would need a beforeChangeParent
  to detach element from parent, and afterChangeParent to re-attach to the 
  new. This would be only called by formulae when a value of HasParent or 
  HasAncestor changes. Default value would be to call onClose and onInit
  
- print for IsTo is incorrect
- be able to desactivate a module (sound,display,input,gui,...) by config
- callgrind shows that desactivating gui and input in a system with no gui 
  allow to go up to 80 ships !!
- refactor types : Object, to catch NULL call by using kind of shared_ptr
- controlers ... during simulation of a controler, the updates on its trait 
  should not be triggered (could remove two checks in physics and gui)
- normalise headers : all non used headers should be in implementation. 
  Used headers are : 
  - trait
  - object
  - deduced trait (to be rennamed in deduction)
  - model 
  ...
  
  Create a kernel.h header containg all the stuff...   
- add traits on relations ? 
- all members should be encapsulated, even for own class : allow to change 
  storage (object pool...) for allocation optimisation
- create an object pool per model, a pool on views too... boost::object_pool 
- display the list of used formulaes (number and kind)
- count the create/destroy of objects, of traits
- display the average size of objects (how many traits/views/deduced traits...)

* Input :
- Bug : mouse go faster on right than left !!!

* Sound : 
- bug : sometimes no sound when replaying the mission but difficult to 
  automate
  
* GUI : 
- add input config validation : cannot save or back till it is correct

* Model :
- add performance tests 
  
* Kernel : 
- the error message on udpate during update could be better : 
  the updated trait names, the object names... (ideally the stack)

* GUI : 
- validation of the mission.
- drag and drop from Active Players to Pilot and conversely
- save/load missions

* Model : 
- bug : adding a mapping on an already assigned key does not worK ?
- add a maximum distance on target display
- add a current ship name indicator, plus status
- add a damage indicator
     
* All : 
- Custom mission controler dealt with victory/ending conditions and leads 
  to game over state

* Packaging
- inspire from funguloid package for debian/ubuntu packaging
- Info : make install does not work on win32 : libtool refuses to link with Ogre 
  (wheread it works in normal make !!), probably a limitation of msys package
   
* Model : 
- if we have several lasers : only one will shoot !
  either propagate commands every where or find another solution 

- Event traits like Collision, Shot should be implemented through 
  a common interface : Model::Event base class...
  Maybe better to have a Kernel::Event because Controler or View cannot 
  have an update method (it has no meaning)   
     
- ShootingHelper may connect several lasers (calculus is made on 
  average speed) and can harmonize lasers (re-orient them to touch a 
  position in the ship axe and at target distance)

- Laser whould not be able to be too much synchronized (max angle)

- Lasers on a ship should all point to the same direction, which is the 
  direction of the ship ... coherence test

- add configurable laser colour (depending of laser beam type)

- Detector : handle of additional data (hit points, ...)
  They can both be obtained by the detector. Maybe we should use traits 
  instead of class attributes for increasing extendability (by adding speed 
  ...). Detectors could then be caractrized by their detection abilities :
  SpeedDetector&MassDetector... but it is not clear now

- be able to get bouding box (?) and perform ray 
  casting inside Model. Code could rely on Ogre but we would be an 
  encapsulation.

- should define isInside like 
  IsInside <=> parent(Positionned ^ Sized) ^ Positionned
  i.e., being descendant means that we are inside 
  changing node position can then move object hierarchy

- PhysicalWorld <=> Whole ??
  PhysicalObject should not depend on mobile ?
  
* GUI : 
- add key shortcuts for clicable buttons
 
* Display :
- when initing ogre, close any already openned ogre objects in other 
  modules
- find a way to preload ressources as needed (some ressources may appear 
  during game like explosions, lasers) some ressources are known like 
  ships...
- make a loading bar : create a ressource loading queue (inspire from 
  Ogre::ResourceBackgroundQueue that is not by default on ogre package)  
  
* Input :
- be able to map any axis on anything
- send wheel mouse to CEGUI
- add Maj+Control in key handling : treat them as modifiers ?
- handle pov buttons as buttons ?

* Physic : 
- migrate Model::PhysicalObject and Model::PhysicalWorld to Physic (for 
  better separation of concerns) --> not so sure ?
- separate simulations : maybe objects can be simulated one by one in its 
  own world !! should not have any complication for movement except for 
  collision response. This could facilitate unit range to keep around one.
- be more precise than bounding sphere for collision : use bounding box for 
  example 
  
* Sound : 
- Bug : segmentation fault when sound is already used by another process
- Bug : infinite loop when no sound device is found...
- Refactoring : every event sound is the same : make a general view on event and get the 
  sound name by a function 
  
* Kernel :
- add better errors on object structure
- maybe call axis should take a Percentage
- be able to copy an object, use read and add a write to Traits.
- relation transitive close (?)
- relation reflexive closure (?)
- relation inheritance (?)
    
* all :
- make use of boost unit library, 
  @see http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_40_0/doc/html/boost_units.html
- deduce meta structure
  # use a metamodel 
  # use gccxml
  # use a modified doxygen
  # instead of generating code, genetate an xml structure for attributes, 
    getter and setters ?  (it would be ridiculous : better forget c++ then)
  # create an over language
- how can we take advantage of multi-core systems ? for example, during 
  ai simulation, we could calculate commands in threads... or during physics 
  simulate world layers also in threads
  interpretor is also a good location for threading, provided all model 
  accesses are mutexed. 
  
* Network :
- choose library
- udp for position update of physical objects
- tcp for structural operations (creation destruction)
- test if position is sent only when moving
- mock network : receive position updates and in other side check that correct 
  messages are sent

* icons are in /usr/share/icons/oxygen
* ulimit -c unlimited
